Dear Sophie is created by a concerned father for its daughter.

In today's society it is common to witness [gender bias][1]. Toys
specifically targetted for girls or boys. Stereotypical subdivision of
jobs in man's jobs and women's jobs. Sports which are "meant" to be
performed by girls or boys.

It is clear that a young women which is aspiring a technical job has a
hard time pursuing her goal.

This site is created to help out the future female technocrati by
collecting motivational advice from female role models. The format is
that of a letter addressed to Sophie.

### Sophie

Sophie was a year and a half when this site was created. It is unclear
what Sophie wants te be when she grows up. But if she choices to
persue a technical career this site will have her back.
